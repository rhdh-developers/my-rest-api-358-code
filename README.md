## Repositories

| Repo | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [`my-rest-api-358-code`](https://github.com/rhdh-developers/my-rest-api-358-code) | Source code (this repo) |

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## Dev Spaces

Open this repo directly in OpenShift Dev Spaces using the factory URL:

```
https://<your-devspaces-host>/f?url=https://github.com/rhdh-developers/my-rest-api-358-code
```

The Dev Spaces host is the route exposed by the OpenShift Dev Spaces operator in your cluster.

## CI/CD

If your GitHub org protects `main`, use a branch and pull request; merging into `main` still triggers the push webhook.

Pushes to `main` trigger a Tekton pipeline that:

1. Clones this repo and builds a container image with Buildah.
2. Pushes the image to the internal OpenShift image registry.
3. Updates `k8/gitops/deployment.yaml` in the k8 repo with the new image digest.
4. ArgoCD detects the change and rolls out the new deployment.

## Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/v1/hello` | Hello world response |
| GET | `/health` | Health check |
